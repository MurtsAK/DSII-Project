"""

Things you need to know:
Data preprocessing is assumed to be reading data from a CSV file.
Graph-based modeling is done using NetworkX library.
Tree-based algorithms are demonstrated using NetworkX's minimum_spanning_tree function.
Hash table implementation is implicit as Python dictionaries.
Visualization is performed using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
Community detection is shown using NetworkX's Girvan-Newman algorithm.
Centrality measures are calculated using NetworkX's built-in functions.
Please replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual path to your dataset CSV file. 
Also, ensure that your dataset CSV file has columns named 'source', 'target', and 'weight'
